##Context 
Visa applicants, advisors, regional adminisrators, interface system, data protection officers
visa consultant officers, customer service and system administrators are 
some of the actors involved in the visa processing systemshown in the context diagram. because each actor uses the sytem in a
different way, prper system functionality and data security depend on specific acess controls and data protection laws.

##decision 
in order to govern right for various actors inside the visa processing 
system and make sure that each actor may only access the data and functionallity
required for their role, we have chosen to create a role based access control(RBAC)
system

##rationale  
to handle user permissions in a safe and effective manner, a role based access
control system is necessary. in order to comply with data protection 
rules, it  makes managing user privleges easier, upholds the concept of least
privilege and makes sure that only authrsoded peopple can access sensitive
applicant data

##implications 
Training for staff will be required to make sure that all participants are
aware of their access privileges and limitations.
