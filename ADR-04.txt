##Context 
A number of services, including a database, email system, file storage, 
and background check service, are shown in the code diagram for the visa 
processing system. The application submission process, eligibility verification, 
and retrieval of visa categories for particular nations are all managed by the system.

##decision 
For the visa processing system, we have chosen to use a Service-Oriented Architecture 
in order to make it easier for the different components to communicate with other services, 
as shown in the code diagram.

##rationale  
A scalable, adaptable, and agile architecture made possible by SOA encourages reusability 
and maintainability while facilitating integration with various services [Erl, 2016]. Additionally, 
this architecture facilitates the modularization of business operations, which allows the system to adjust 
to evolving legal and regulatory requirements [Krafzig, 2005].

##implications 
Developers and system administrators will need training in SOA design patterns and principles
