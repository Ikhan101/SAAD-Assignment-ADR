##Context 
The architecture of the visa processing system is displayed by the container
diagram and includes a web application, a single-page application, an API application,
and additional services including email system, payment gateway, background check service, 
document verification service, and file storage. Every component has a specific purpose and needs to be 
clearly defined, as well as the protocols for interacting with the other components.

##decision 
We have made the decision to isolate every part of the visa processing system
into a separate container in order to support better service orchestration, 
autonomous scalability, and deployment.

##rationale  
Since containerisation improves scalability, portability, and consistency of deployment settings,
it is widely accepted as a best practice for contemporary software architecture [Bernstein, 2014].
A greater degree of service isolation can be attained through the use of containers, which reduces 
the complexity of interdependencies, improves security, and simplifies setup [Newman, 2015].

##implications 
the development team must be trained in container management best 
practice.
