##Context 
The component diagram of the visa processing system shows its architecture, 
that includes a number of loosely coupled, independently deployable components, 
such as a database, sign-in controller, email component, security components, 
single-page application, and various services like document verification and 
payment processing.

##decision 
For the visa processing system, i decided to use a microservices architecture, 
in which every part is created, implemented, and run as a separate service.

##rationale  
Following the guidelines of contemporary software development methods, 
a microservices architecture approach allows for independent scaling, 
simpler maintenance, and quicker deployment cycles for each component 
[Newman 2015]. Continuous delivery and deployment methods, which are essential 
to the development and operations team's agility, are supported by this architecture 
[FowlerMicroservices].

##implications 
Additional monitoring and logging services will ge necessary to oversea the distributed system
